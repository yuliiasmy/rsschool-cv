    ### ABOUT ME

    My ultimate career goal is to become an experienced web developer, and I believe that my passion for technology, ability to work in a team, and willingness to learn new skills will help me achieve that goal. I am currently seeking a web developer intern position to gain valuable work experience and learn new skills in a dynamic and supportive environment.

    ### Code Examples

    ```html
    <p class = "world"> Hello world, nice to meet you </p>
    ```

    ```css
    .world{
        color: #006400;
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    function multiply(a, b){
        return a * b
    }
    ```
